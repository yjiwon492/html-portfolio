<h2>The Top 3 Movies of All-time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Definitely one of the most beautiful and heartwarming anime movies I have seen.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<P>I couln't really figure out which one of the triology is best. 
    I've watched them all with my wife and we loved the entire series. Give it a go!</P>

<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>A classic and I can say without a doubt, Star Wars is a classic and a fun one to watch if you enjoy sci-fi. 
    Not the favorite for the wife but for a nerd like me, This is an awesome movie series to binge.</p>
